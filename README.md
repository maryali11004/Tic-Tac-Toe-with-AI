# ðŸŽ® Smart Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the ultimate showdown between you and a cunning AI opponent in the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe! ðŸ¤© Ready to put your strategic skills to the test?

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s the Game About?

This isnâ€™t your average Tic-Tac-Toe. Weâ€™ve supercharged it with Python and Pygame to create a game where you go head-to-head against an AI that uses the powerful **minimax algorithm** to make the best moves. Itâ€™s like playing against a digital mastermind! ðŸ§ 

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **AI Opponent:** Challenge yourself with an AI that thinks ahead and makes strategic moves.
- **Minimalist Design:** Simple and clean interface that lets you focus on the game.
- **Restart Option:** Made a mistake? Hit `R` to restart the game and try again.

## ðŸŽ¯ Installation

Get ready to dive into the game! Hereâ€™s how to set up your own Tic-Tac-Toe arena:

1. **Install Python 3** (if you donâ€™t already have it). Get it from [Pythonâ€™s official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Pygame** - the magical library that makes the game come to life:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. **Run the Game** - Just type this command and get ready to play:

    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- **Click on the Grid**: Select a square to make your move.
- **Press `R` to Restart**: Starting over is easy-peasy if you need a fresh start.

## ðŸ§© How It Works

Our AI opponent is not just any opponentâ€”itâ€™s powered by the minimax algorithm! This algorithm looks ahead at all possible moves and decides the optimal one. Think of it as your very own digital strategist. ðŸŒŸ
